# Hi there! 👋  
**Welcome to My GitHub Profile**

I'm Alfonso Javier Camacho Salas, and I’m passionate about **Robotics**, **Machine Learning**, and **3D Printing**. My journey in technology began with a strong curiosity about how machines work, which grew into a deep interest in **computer science** and its practical applications in **artificial intelligence** and **automation**.

I’ve honed my skills through hands-on projects, such as developing a **financial machine learning model** and creating a fully functional **3D-printed Iron Man helmet**. Currently, I am working on organizing the first school robotics tournament in the Magdalena region, **SAMBOT**, aimed at sparking innovation in the local community.

Beyond personal projects, I love sharing knowledge and inspiring others. I co-founded the podcast **Líderes sin Filtro**, where we discuss topics on personal growth and development. I’m also passionate about promoting **STEM education** and helping others unlock their potential through technology.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don’t hesitate to connect with me on **LinkedIn** or **Instagram**. I’m always open to collaborations that drive **innovation** and **social impact** through technology!
